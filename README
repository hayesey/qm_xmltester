qm_xmltester
===================

This is a simple Java Servlet for testing XML-RPC with QueueMetrics.

http://www.queuemetrics.com

I use it with Tomcat but it's such a small thing it'll probably work with any servlet container.

http://tomcat.apache.org

I wrote this several years ago for my own use, it's handy for seeing the exact output from the various XML-RPC requests from Queuemetrics while writing your custom reports.

There is a single Java class in the WEB-INF/classes folder, this does all the work.  You need the "invoker" servlet on to use this.

There is a simple compile bash script too.  The WEB-INF/lib folder contains the 3rd party Java packages you'll need to compile against.

For now the URL to the XML-RPC server is hard-coded into the code so this needs editing.  If I get round to it I'll put this into an input box on the web page and/or a settings file.

There's also a ready compiled class file for Java 1.6+ (which is useless to you for now given the above)!

Have fun.
